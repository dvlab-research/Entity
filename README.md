# EntitySeg Toolbox: Towards open-world and high-quality image segmentation

EntitySeg is an open source toolbox which towards open-world and high-quality image segmentation. All works related to image segmentation from our group are open-sourced here.

To date, EntitySeg implements the following algorthms:

* [Open-World Entity Segmentation](Entity/README.md) --- _released_
* [High Quality Segmentation for Ultra High-resolution Images](High-Quality-Segmention/README.md) --- _released_
* [CaSSL: Class-agnostic Semi-Supervised Learning for Detection and Segmentation]() ---_code to be released_


## Usage

Please refer to the README.md of each project. All projects shared the similar detectron2 base code and could support each other.
